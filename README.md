# Developer Cheatsheets

A collection of developer-driven cheatsheets for quick reference. For now these cheatsheets are presented as Markdown files, but eventually these cheatsheets will be turned into an interactive web resource.

Note: These cheetsheets are just getting started and are wildly incomplete, but will be updated overtime. For now, they are mainly here for my reference, but anyone is welcome to benefit, or contribute.

Browse to the individual cheatsheets:

- **[Git](https://github.com/radiovisual/cheatsheets/blob/master/git.md)** A cheatsheet outlying the most common use cases in Git
- **UNIX** Get to know the most common UNIX commands (coming soon)
- **Shell** Learn to use Shell commands to increase your productivity (coming soon)
- **Javascript** Document some of the "trickier" parts of the intermediate-to-advanced side of javascript. (coming soon)
